<p>Mike Clark, author of <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/sk/auto/">Pragmatic Project Automation</a>, caught up with me for a few quick <a href="http://www.pragmaticautomation.com/cgi-bin/pragauto.cgi/Tools/RailsAutomation.rdoc">questions about the automation</a> of Rails. A snippet:</p>
<blockquote><b>Mike:</b> Everybody who tries Rails raves about how it makes them super productive. What types of automation does Rails employ to help developers create great apps so quickly?<br>
<br>
<b>David:</b> The basic philosophy is to encourage good behavior through invitations. So, for example, when you use the generator to create a new model or controller, it also creates unit test stubs that are all hooked up. You just enter a new test case and off you go. The same goes to fixtures, where a <span class="caps">YAML</span> file is already created and hooked up, just waiting for you to input the data&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>We also talk about Rake and continuos integration with Damage Control. Additionally, it was great to see Mike so excited about Rails:</p>
<blockquote>Rails projects are popping up all over. I just started converting a small J2EE project to Rails, and let me just say that Rails is highly addictive stuff.</blockquote>
