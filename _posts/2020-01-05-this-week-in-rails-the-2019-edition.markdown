There have been 494 contributors to Rails in 2019. Wow, that's a staggering number! Thank you all for making Rails better.

### [Rails 6.0 released](https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2019/8/15/Rails-6-0-final-release/)

Rails 6 includes headline features such as parallel testing, multi database support, new Zeitwerk autoloader along with new frameworks added to the Rails family.

### [Two new frameworks added to Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/37872)
