<p>Bruce Perens is working on <a href="http://perens.com/FreeSoftware/ModelSecurity">model security</a> for Active Record sponsored by <a href="http://sourcelabs.com/">Sourcelabs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>I&#8217;ve developed ModelSecurity, a new Ruby on Rails facility that helps<br>
developers implement a security defense in depth by implementing<br>
access control within the data model.<br>
<br>
If you are like most developers, you think about security when you<br>
program controllers and views. But a bug in your controller or view can<br>
compromise the security of your application, unless your data model has<br>
also been secured.<br>
<br>
The economical, flexible, and extremely readable means of specifying<br>
access controls provided by ModelSecurity makes it easier for the<br>
developer to think about security, and makes security assumptions that<br>
might otherwise live in one developers head concrete and communicable<br>
to others.</blockquote>
<p>Please check it out and give Bruce a hand with testing.</p>
