<p>Norman Timmler from <a href="http://inlet-media.de/">inlet media e.K.</a> is looking for a Rails developer in northern Germany:</p>
<blockquote>I&#8217;m starting a another project for one of my customers and need some<br>
qualified RoR assistance. If you are interested, you should have done an entire Rails project. The user interface will need some nice ajax tricks, so Javascript shouldn&#8217;t be a foreign language.<br>
<br>
The project is quite interesting and will probably drive Rails to it&#8217;s limits. I can&#8217;t tell more at this point, but be sure it is no boring thing!</blockquote>
