<p>Rael Dornfest seems to be having a chocolate good time digging into the crunchy Rails. As the Chief Technology Officer at O&rsquo;Reilly Media, he certainly has a good touch with the pulse of the industry and <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/6782">this is what he&#8217;s been seeing</a>:</p>
<blockquote>The chocolate in this equation is Ruby on Rails: a framework for building database-driven web applications. But far from being yet another web development framework, Rails is known for its small footprint, low barrier to entry, flexible-yet-powerful, &#8220;more joy and less code&#8221; approach to application building.<br>
<br>
Indeed, we&#8217;ve been seeing interest in Ruby explode over the past few months: no doubt in large part due to the swift adoption (or at least tire-kicking) of Rails.<br>
<br>
Ruby on Rails was off to a good start even before bringing Ajax on board; and it&#8217;s only gone from strength to strength since.</blockquote>
<p>Thanks a bunch, Rael!</p>
