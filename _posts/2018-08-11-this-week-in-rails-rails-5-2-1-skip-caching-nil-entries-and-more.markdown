Namaste everyone! This is [Prathamesh](https://twitter.com/_cha1tanya) bringing you the latest news from the Rails world with some rain and chai from Pune.

### [Rails 5.2.1 is out in the wild](https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2018/8/7/Rails-5-2-1-has-been-released/)

Rails 5.2.1 is [released](https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2018/8/7/Rails-5-2-1-has-been-released/). Give it a try and check out all the awesome features.

### [Better error handling of Active Storage adapters](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/33540)

Now, the Active Storage service adapter names can be lower case or upper case. Also, a nice error message is printed if the service adapter class can't be loaded.

### [Support for skipping caching of nil entries](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/25437)

While caching data from external services, sometimes we may get _nil_ values. Most probably we don't want to cache them. Here is an option _skip\_nil: true/false_ to skip caching of such entries.

### [Fix the issue of build not getting called on extension for has_many association](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/33454)

Earlier, the extended _build_ method was not called properly for the _has\_many_ association which was being accepted by using _accepts\_nested\_attributes\_for_.  
  
This issue is fixed now.
