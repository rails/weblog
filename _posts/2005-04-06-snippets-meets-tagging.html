<p>Peter Cooper has just launched <a href="http://www.bigbold.com/snippets/">Snippets</a>. It&#8217;s a paste site that injects the wonderful idea of tagging into the mix. Peter announced it with:</p>
<blockquote>Less than two days ago I had an idea. I come across lots of useful snippets of code for the command line, Perl, Ruby, <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, whatever, and store them in a big text file. This was hard to organize, so I figured it&#8217;d make sense to store them in a del.icio.us style tagged system.<br>
<br>
So off I set, and some 28 hours later (including sleep), the system is launched! Welcome to Snippets. Enjoy. More proof of the power of Rails!</blockquote>
