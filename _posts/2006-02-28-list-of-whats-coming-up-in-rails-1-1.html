<p>Today someone on the Rails mailing list asked, innocently enough, &#8220;Is there by any chance some document available summarizing all the<br>
(major) beautiful new stuff in Rails 1.1?&#8221; As is to be expected, he received instructions on how to do a diff between the 1.0 release tag and trunk as well as links to the <span class="caps">CHANGELOGS</span>. He used &#8220;summarize&#8221; carefully. Turns out there was nothing like he was looking for. Well, not for long&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://scottraymond.net">Scott Raymond</a>, of <a href="http://www.blinksale.com/">Blinksale</a> and <a href="http://iconbuffet.com/">IconBuffet</a> fame, rolled up his sleeves and did the dirty work for the rest of us. So, as requested, here is <a href="http://scottraymond.net/articles/2006/02/28/rails-1.1">a summary of what will be new in Rails 1.1</a>. Thanks Scott.</p>
