Hi everyone,

I am happy to announce that Rails 4.0.1.rc1 has been released. This is a bug fix release and
includes more than 450 commits.

This release comes up with an important change on how Active Record handles subsequent `order` calls.
In Rails 4.0.0 when you do something like this:

```ruby
User.order("name asc").order("created_at desc")
```

The later called `order` will be prepended in the ORDER BY clause resulting on this SQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY created_at desc, name asc
```

In Rails 4.0.1 the behavior of Rails 3 has been restored and the generated ORDER BY clause
looks like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY name asc, created_at desc
```

We chose to revert the behavior because it added a major backward incompatibility that made
harder to have an upgrade path without major changes in the application code. So we took the most
conservative path of reverting it to be consistent with the idea of having a smoother upgrade path
to Rails 4.

Also, this release adds some performance improvements to make Rails 4 even faster.

If no regressions are found we will release 4.0.1 final final this Tuesday, on October 22, 2013.
If you find one, please open an Issue on GitHub and mention me (@rafaelfranca) on it,
so that we can fix it before the final release.
