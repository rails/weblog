Hi everyone,

I am happy to announce that Rails 4.2.9.rc2 has been released.

This is going to be the last bug fix release of the 4.2 series, so please test this release candidate.

If no regressions are found, expect the final release on Monday, June 26, 2017.
If you find one, please open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/new)
and mention me (@rafaelfranca) on it, so that we can fix it before the final release.
