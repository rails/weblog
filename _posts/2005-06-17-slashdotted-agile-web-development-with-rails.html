<p>As <a href="http://books.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/16/1914251">the 6th Slashdotting of Rails</a> comes a review of the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/">Agile Web Development with Rails</a> book. It&#8217;s written from the perspective of a <span class="caps">PHP</span> programmer who&#8217;s coming to terms with the patterns and approaches used. And he&#8217;s certainly enjoying the move:</p>
<blockquote>Whether you believe the hype or not of &#8220;super productivity,&#8221; &#8220;Ten times faster development,&#8221; and &#8220;Better than anything else,&#8221; Ruby on Rails is a great tool to add to your belt. In fact, I find myself using it exclusively for Web apps, and I catch myself using python and <span class="caps">PHP</span> less and less and Ruby more and more for my day to day programs.<br>
<br>
If you want to learn Ruby on Rails, Agile Web Development with Ruby on Rails is a great choice, and will probably be the definitive book on the subject.</blockquote>
<p>The ensuing comments definitely also reflect the time passed since the first Slashdotting. There&#8217;s less ignorant wailing and more insightful help and suggestions. With enough exposure the baseline of knowledge is bound to rise.</p>
