Hi everyone,

I am happy to announce that Rails 4.2.10.rc1 has been released!

Per our release policy Rails 4.2 is no longer supported except for severe security fixes, but the last release introduced some regressions that warranted a release.

If no new regressions are found, expect the final release on Wednesday, September 27, 2017.
If you find a regression, please open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/new)
and mention me (@eileencodes) on it.
