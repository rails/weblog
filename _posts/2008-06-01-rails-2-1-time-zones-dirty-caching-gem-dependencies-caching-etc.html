<p>Rails 2.1 is now available for general consumption with all the features and fixes we&#8217;ve been putting in over the last six months since 2.0. This has been a huge effort by a very wide range of contributors helping to make it happen.</p>
<p>Over the past six months, we&#8217;ve had 1,400 contributors creating patches and vetting them. This has resulted in 1,600+ patches. A truly staggering number. And lots of that has made it into this release.</p>
<p><b>New features</b><br>
The new major features are:</p>
