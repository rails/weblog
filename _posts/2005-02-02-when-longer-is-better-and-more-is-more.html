<p>The father of Java, James Gosling, is traveling the down under and has some.. erhm.. &#8220;interesting&#8221; thoughts on scripting languages. I&#8217;m getting these <a href="http://www.twelve71.org/blogs/alan/archives/000729.html">sound bytes</a> from Alan Fracis&#8217; summary of the Sidney meeting, so there is a chance they might not be accurate, but here they are:</p>
<blockquote>Opinion of script languages &#8211; Perl, Python, Ruby, <span class="caps">PHP</span><br>
Program density and comprehensibility are inversely related<br>
Write Once, Read Never. <span class="caps">TECO</span> was worse. Rapid Development<br>
static typing gets you to prod faster, scripting gets you<br>
to demo first. easy to write small things, harder to wrote <br>
big things.</blockquote>
<p>Oy. First of all, lumping all these dynamic languages together under the convenient banner of &#8220;scripting&#8221; to attack them in symphony is disingenuous in itself. But claiming that writing a long program leads to a more comprehensible one is just plain silly. I hope that wasn&#8217;t what he meant.</p>
<p>Additionally, the artificial distinction between &#8220;demo&#8221; and &#8220;prod&#8221; in a post-agile world rings awfully hollow in that High Priest of Architecture kind-of-way. Once more oy.</p>
