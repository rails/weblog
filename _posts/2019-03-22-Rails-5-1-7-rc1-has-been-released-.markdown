Hi everyone,

I am happy to announce that Rails 5.1.7.rc1 has been released.

This is going to be the final bug fix release for the 5.1 series, so please make sure you test
the release candidates to make sure no regressions are found.

If no regressions are found, expect the final release on Wednesday, March 27, 2019.
If you find one, please open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/new)
and mention me (@rafaelfranca) on it, so that we can fix it before the final release.
