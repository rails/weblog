<p>Curt Hibbs has invaded O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s ONLamp.com once more to follow up on his hugely popular (and Slashdot linked) article Rolling with Ruby on Rails. In <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/03/03/rails.html">this second part</a>, he expands on the recipe application by adding additional manipulation tools and categories. The end of the article also contains a summary of the many Rails success stories and a peek at the many features Curt doesn&#8217;t have time to go into.</p>
<p>While Curt took a lot of flak for claiming Rails to be a silver bullet, it doesn&#8217;t seem to slow him down. In the conclusion, he writes:</p>
<blockquote>Rails is not your run-of-the-mill, proof-of-concept web framework. It is the next level in web programming, and the developers who use it will make web applications faster than those who don&#8217;t; single developers can be as productive as whole teams. Best of all, it&#8217;s available right now, under an <span class="caps">MIT</span> license.<br>
<br>
I believe that there hasn&#8217;t been an improvement in productivity like this in recent programming history.</blockquote>
