<p>Justin Gehtland has been working on an application using the Java/Spring/Hibernate/<span class="caps">JSTL</span> stack for about 5 months. He started redoing it in Rails as an experiment and <a href="http://www.relevancellc.com/blogs/?p=29">found something surprising</a>:</p>
<blockquote>I&rsquo;ve been able to re-implement 80% of the functionality in just under four nights of work. Some of that most assuredly has to do with the fact that I understand the domain pretty thoroughly by this point. But a lot of it has to do with the sheer productivity of the framework.</blockquote>
<p>He attributes this to convention over configuration, and how the &#8220;&#8230;configure, compile, deploy, reset cycle for running tests is time consuming on my original stack, and non-existent with Rails&#8221;. But all that is just the familiar tune on &#8220;ease of development&#8221;. Here&#8217;s the real kicker:</p>
<blockquote>Rails is actually faster.<br>
<br>
At runtime, the Rails implementation is at least as fast as the original stack in almost every case, and for a not-insignificant portion of actions, actually performs better. I haven&rsquo;t run benchmarks yet, but I will as this effort progresses, but I was shocked (shocked, I say) to discover this.</blockquote>

<p>Welcome on over, Justin! I can&#8217;t wait to read more about your adventures with Rails. And best of luck convincing your customer to dump the 5-month effort in favor of your 4-night rewrite. I&#8217;ll be cheering for you.</p>
