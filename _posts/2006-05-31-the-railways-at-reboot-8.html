<p>Finnish superstar <a href="http://jlaine.net">Jarkko Laine</a>, who&#8217;s been in the Rails community since day one, is going to be hosting a discussion this Thursday around 9PM at <a href="http://reboot.dk/">Reboot 8</a> in Copenhagen called <a href="http://reboot.dk/wiki/The_Railways">The Railways</a>.</p>
<p>The idea of           <br>
the discussion is to bring together people who have already dipped             <br>
their toes in the Rails koolaid with those who have contemplated doing so but have not yet made the jump. The conversation will be around            <br>
topics like:</p>
<ul>
	<li>What in the Rails way has struck people as most important?              <br>
What has made the most difference?</li>
	<li>Real-world war stories. How has Rails made something possible/               <br>
easier/more productive?</li>
	<li>Whatever people feel is important to tell Rails newbies.</li>
</ul>
<p>All Rails people attending Reboot are kindly asked to participate in           <br>
the discussion and think beforehand of a few good stories they can             <br>
tell to spread the love.</p>
