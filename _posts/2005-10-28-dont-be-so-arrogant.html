<p>Some times you just need an outside opinion to achieve true clarity of vision. Thankfully, there&#8217;s always such an angel available when <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000531.html#comments">you need it the most</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Rails shows some promise but much, much more is needed. Sorry to say this but you need stored procedure support (I know that&#8217;s a sensitive subject), less coupling with the data schema, data-aware tags in <span class="caps">XML</span> format and more people to knock out serious bugs.<br>
 <br>
Don&#8217;t be so arrogant.</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, Pearson. I don&#8217;t know how I could have somehow missed these essential features for so long. I mean, how can we expect to be taken serious before we have data-aware tags in <span class="caps">XML</span> format? And what <i>is</i> up with all that coupling with the data schema?!</p>
<p>Actually, I don&#8217;t think we can get that 1.0 out the door now. With this renewed vision for the true frontiers for Rails, I think we need at least a few months in the shop yet. Of course, we&#8217;ll use that time to get all those people to knock out our serious bugs.</p>
<p>This is indeed all for the best.</p>
