<p>We&#8217;re putting the finishing touches on the <a href="http://railsconf.org">RailsConf 2007</a> schedule this week.  Given the huge number of high quality proposals (well over 3 times the number from last year), we&#8217;re working on putting together a fourth track.</p>
<p>We have also finalized an exciting lineup of keynote speakers for the conference.  I was frankly a bit worried about the keynote lineup as we started initial planning of RailsConf 2007.  <a href="http://2006.railsconf.org">Last year&#8217;s</a> keynotes were going to be hard to live up to.  My fears were ill-founded.  We ended up with a program to be really excited about.</p>

<p>The RailsConf program promises to be thought-provoking, trend-starting, entertaining, tone-setting, and, most of all, fun.</p>
<p>See you in May!</p>
