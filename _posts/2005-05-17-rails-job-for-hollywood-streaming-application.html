<p>Now don&#8217;t tell me there&#8217;s no glitz or glamour working with Rails. Tom Wolf from World of Wonder is looking to hire a Rails programmer to build a video delivery system in Ruby on Rails. Straight out of Hollywood:</p>
<blockquote> We are looking for a freelance developer who can help us with a large web project involving video delivery, user accounts, content management and online purchasing.<br>
<br>
The developer should have experience building modern, scalable and manageable web applications with ruby. Experience with quicktime streaming sever a plus.<br>
<br>
The project is in its initial stages of design, so this is an opportunity for you to put your own ideas into action. Please send an email to twolf@worldofwonder.net for more information.</blockquote>
