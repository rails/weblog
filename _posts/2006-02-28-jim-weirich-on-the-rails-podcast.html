<p><a href="http://onestepback.org/">Jim Weirich</a> has been using Ruby for ages. He&#8217;s one of the early-adopter all-stars from the days before Rails. Rails programmers will be familiar with his wildly popular and influencial <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">Rake</a> and <a href="http://builder.rubyforge.org/">Builder</a> projects. He&#8217;s also one of the main developers of <a href="http://docs.rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a>, which is scheduled to be included with Ruby in an upcoming release.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm he brings to his work and talking about his work make it clear that he has a genuine love for programming. On top of it all, cliches aside, he&#8217;s one of the nicest people you&#8217;ll ever meet.</p>
<p>So what a treat to have him on the <br>
<a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails podcast</a>. <a href="http://paranode.com/~topfunky/audio/2006/Jim-Weirich.m4a">Have a listen</a>.</p>
<p>Cheers to <a href="http://topfunky.com/">Geoffrey Grosenbach</a> for snagging yet another great guest.</p>
