<blockquote>john: i was going to the airport and the driver (the car service we use) asks if i know martin fowler.<br>
<br>
john: i said yes, why do you ask&#8230;<br>
<br>
john: he shows me his RoR Agile book by Dave Thomas<br>
<br>

<br>
john: Smal world&#8230;He used to be a developer b4 he moved from london here&#8230;hard time getting a job&#8230;</blockquote>
