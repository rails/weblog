<p>It has been made official. The title of the first Rails book is going to be <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html">Agile Web Development with Rails</a> and its currently being written by Dave Thomas. A small group of reviewers, including yours truly, have been reviewing the first chapters as they come of Dave&#8217;s printing fingers already. And it&#8217;s looking mighty good!</p>
<p>A few choice bits from the introduction to the book:</p>
<blockquote>You&#8217;ll see how easy it is to install Rails using your web server of choice (such as Apache or lighttpd) or using its own included web server. You&#8217;ll be writing applications that work with your favorite database (MySQL, Oracle, Postgres, and more) in no time at all.<br>
<br>
You&#8217;ll create a complete online store application in the extended tutorial section, so you&#8217;ll see how a full Rails application is developed&#8212;-iteratively and rapidly.<br>
<br>
<b>Rails is the framework of choice for the new generation of Web&#160;2.0 developers.</b></blockquote>
