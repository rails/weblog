<p>Jason Fried from <a href="http://www.37signals.com">37signals</a> <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2005/03/10/basecamp.html">talks about the origins of Rails</a> with Marc Hedlund from O&#8217;Reilly:</p>
<blockquote>Ruby on Rails is the open source web application framework we extracted from <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a>. When we built Basecamp we didn&#8217;t know we were building Rails at the same time, but that&#8217;s exactly how it happened. Basecamp came first; Rails was born from Basecamp. Basecamp was the divine chicken, Rails was the egg.<br>
<br>
I had some natural hesitation about using Ruby at first (&#8220;What the #@!* is Ruby?&#8221;&#8220;Why don&#8217;t we just use <span class="caps">PHP</span>&#8212;it served us well before?&#8221;), but David cogently made the case and I bought it. I&#8217;m thrilled with the results.</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m sure a few of the readers here are thankful that Jason decided to trust yours truly and bet on Ruby :)</p>
