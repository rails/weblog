<p>Rails is certainly going through rapid improvement. Marcel Molina used to joke on #rubyonrails that he was so busy refactoring his application to take advantage of all the new goodies coming out that he didn&#8217;t have time to do any real work.</p>
<p>The rapid improvement is increasing the number of people for whom Rails hits the sweet spot, though. Kellan Elliot-McCrea from LaughingMeme <a href="http://laughingmeme.org/archives/002842.html">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Broke down, saw the light, whatever you want to call it, but I finally whipped up my first Rails app last night.<br>
<br>
When I first looked at Rails a few months ago, I liked what I saw but was frustrated by the extreme magicalness of the framework which baked a number of assumptions into your app I wasn&#8217;t willing to concede. Turns out Rails hit the sweet spot of being good enough, the sweet spot where people pile on and the framework has improved rapidly.</blockquote>
<p>Did you look at Rails a few months ago and decided it wasn&#8217;t you yet? Perhaps it is now.</p>
