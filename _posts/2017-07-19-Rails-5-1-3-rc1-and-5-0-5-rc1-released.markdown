Hi everyone,

I am happy to announce that Rails 5.1.3.rc1 and 5.0.5.rc1 have been released.

If no regressions are found, expect the final releases Monday, July 24, 2017.
If you find one, please open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/new)
and mention me (@kaspth) on it, so that we can fix it before the final release.
