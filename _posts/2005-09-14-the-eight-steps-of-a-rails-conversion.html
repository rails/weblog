<p>Brett at San Antonio Safe List <a href="http://www.sasafelist.org/?cat=5">recalls the process</a> that he has seen folks with <span class="caps">PHP</span>, Python, Java, and <span class="caps">DBA</span> experience go through when meeting Rails:</p>
<ol><li>Everything is so weird.<br>
<li>Everyone is really annoyed by Rails&rsquo; &ldquo;black magic&rdquo; where all this stuff just happens for you.<br>
<li>People realize that programming tasks are handled in a single line.<br>
<li>They have to lookup how to do something Ruby.<br>
<li>They realize how much faster they are building things.<br>
<li>They forget about all other languages and stop saying &ldquo;Well in Java I&rsquo;d do this&#8230;In python it works like this&#8230;Thats just like the ternary operator in Perl&#8230;&rdquo;<br>
<li>They wonder why in the hell that hadn&rsquo;t been playing with this a year ago.<br>
<li>They&rsquo;re on Rails.</ol>
