<p>About the development of SoapBX using Rails, Pelle writes:</p>
<blockquote>I got an idea less than two weeks ago and now as a testament to the<br>
power of Rails I have released the first initial beta version of<br>
SoapBx, with less than 20 hours of programming involved so far.</blockquote>
<p>Congratulations on the launch, Pelle!</p>
