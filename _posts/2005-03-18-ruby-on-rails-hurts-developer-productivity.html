<p>I tried to warn him, but he wouldn&#8217;t listen. Jakob Skjerning, who helped redesign rubyonrails.com and whom I worked with on Daily Rush, has been <a href="http://mentalized.net/journal/2005/03/18/ruby_on_rails_hurts_developer_productivity/">sucked into the Rails vortex</a>:</p>
<blockquote>After having gotten used to RoR for a private project or 2, all the web development stuff I do at work feels ugly, clunky and unproductive, simply because I am not using Ruby on Rails for it.<br>
<br>
So take my advice: If you are stuck doing legacy work on a legacy system, don&rsquo;t think about learning RoR &#8211; you might never want to go back to work if you do.</blockquote>
<p>So let that be a warning to all of the prospect Rails programmers out there. Be careful what you get started with.</p>
<p>We actually have a <a href="http://one.textdrive.com/pipermail/rails/2005-March/004877.html">thread on feeling dirty</a> about not doing Rails on the mailing list right now. <a href="http://techno-weenie.net/">Rick Olson</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote>Going back to <span class="caps">ASP</span>.Net development makes me feel dirty.  What?  I have<br>
to update the stored procedure, the model, the <span class="caps">DAL</span>, the form, and<br>
create a new server control just to add a property???</blockquote>
