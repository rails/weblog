<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Over the past few months, Rails core team member Yehuda Katz has posted a series of great blog articles describing some of the process and technique he&#8217;s used while coding Rails 3 with Carl Lerche.  In case you haven&#8217;t followed his blog posts, I thought I&#8217;d repost them here for your educational reading.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2009/07/19/rails-3-the-great-decoupling/">Rails 3: The Great Decoupling</a> <br>

<p><a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2009/07/01/new-rails-isolation-testing/">New Rails Isolation Testing</a><br>
is about the creation of a new test mixin that runs each test case in its own process.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2009/6-steps-to-refactoring-rails-for-mere-mortals/">6 Steps to Refactoring Rails</a><br>
is about the refactoring philosophy he&#8217;s using when coding Rails 3.</p>
<p><a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2009/06/11/rails-edge-architecture/">Rails Edge Architecture</a><br>

<p><a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2009/04/07/better-module-organization/">Better Module Organization</a><br>

<p><a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2009/03/06/alias_method_chain-in-models/">alias_method_chain in models</a><br>
is about alternatives to using alias_method_chain, some of which made it into Rails 3 refactorings.</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/version3/start">Rails 3 Extension <span class="caps">API</span></a><br>
is where on the new wiki Yehuda has started documenting the new extension APIs which are being added for Rails 3.  There&#8217;s not a whole lot there yet, but be sure to watch this space in the coming weeks.</p>
