<p><a href="http://jobster.com">Jobster</a> is buying into Rails big time. Over the next few months they are looking to <a href="http://www.jobster.com/view.html?i=FMUWJMOPJAJH">hire no fewer than 10 developers</a>. Those over in the <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real</a> camp may cringe at the idea of bulking up your team so quickly, but Jobster <span class="caps">CEO</span> <a href="http://jobster.com/corp/management.jsp">Jason Goldberg</a> aims to keep things small and nimble:<br>
<blockquote><i><br>
One of the cool things we have done at jobster   <br>
   (we think) is to foster small teams which take on big projects in rapid     <br>
   cycles. Rails makes that possible.  With 12 more devs, for instance, we      <br>
   would spin up 4 significant projects.<br>
</i></blockquote></p>
<p>So far Rails has indeed proven to be a great fit.<br>
<blockquote><i><br>
   A team of three engineers tasked with prototyping a compelling consumer     <br>
   product in one month.  They where given complete freedom to do what they    <br>
   wanted, and to build on top of whatever technology they chose.  They chose  <br>
   ruby on rails, completed a successful prototype that will be pushed to our  <br>
   live site shortly.  It was so successful that rails will be the technology  <br>
   that all our new consumer features will be built on.<br>
</i></blockquote><br>
