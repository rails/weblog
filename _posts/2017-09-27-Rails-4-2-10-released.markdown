Hi everyone,

I am happy to announce that Rails 4.2.10 final has been released!

As noted in the rc1 post, Rails 4.2 is no longer supported except for severe security patches, but the last release introduced a couple regressions that warranted a release. Unless more regressions are found this will likely be the last bug fix release for Rails 4.2. :champagne:

## CHANGES since 4.2.9

The following gems had changes since 4.2.9. Changes are listed below, or you can read the CHANGELOG's on GitHub:

* [Action Pack CHANGELOG](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v4.2.10/actionpack/CHANGELOG.md)

> Fix regression in behavior of `normalize_path`.

> In Rails 5 there was a change to ensure the encoding of the original string
in a path was maintained. This was incorrectly backported to Rails 4.2 which
caused a regression.

* [Active Record CHANGELOG](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v4.2.10/activerecord/CHANGELOG.md)

> `Relation#joins` is no longer affected by the target model's
`current_scope`, with the exception of `unscoped`. Fixes #29338.

The remaining gems (Action Mailer, Action View, Active Job, Active Model, Active Support, and Railties) had no changes.
