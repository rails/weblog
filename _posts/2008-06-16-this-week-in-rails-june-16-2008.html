<p>This is the first edition of This Week in Rails. As announced by Gregg Pollack <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/6/10/two-new-weekly-columns">a few days ago</a>, this weekly column will cover highlights from the Rails community. My aim is to provide you with a status update as if you&#8217;d gone on holidays for a week. I will try to be consistent and publish once a week on Sunday or Monday. Being my first shot, I&#8217;ll rely on your feedback to verify that I&#8217;m on the right track and that this is useful to you; so please feel free to express your opinion in the comment section below.</p>
<p>With Rails 2.1 out, most developers are looking forward to upgrading their skills (and projects) to the latest release. If you&#8217;re one of them, I strongly recommend that you check out the second edition of Carlos Brando&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nomedojogo.com/2008/06/15/ruby-on-rails-21-whats-new-second-edition/">Ruby on Rails 2.1 &#8211; Whatâ€™s new</a> free e-book, which is available in both English and Portuguese, with an <a href="http://github.com/carlopecchia/rails21-book/tree/master">Italian translation</a> currently in the works as well. You can also read Rob Anderton&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thewebfellas.com/blog/2008/6/9/rails-2-1-now-with-better-integrated-caching">excellent overview</a> of Rails 2.1&#8217;s improved caching capabilities, as well as its built-in support for memcached.</p>
<p>Last week, Phusion <a href="http://blog.phusion.nl/2008/06/09/phusion-passenger-20-rc-1-and-ruby-enterprise-edition-released/">announced</a> the first release candidate of Passenger 2.0 (aka mod_rails). This release introduces support for Rack, opening the door to alternative web frameworks as well. In the same announcement, <a href="http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/">Ruby Enterprise Edition</a> was formally released. Despite the &#8220;Enterprise&#8221; label, this is a fully Open Source version of Ruby whose main claim is a reduced memory footprint on Linux and Mac OS X.</p>
<p>Speaking of Enterprise, Dr Nic has released version 1.0.2 of his <a href="http://compositekeys.rubyforge.org/">Composite Primary Keys gem</a>. Starting <a href="http://drnicwilliams.com/2008/06/06/composite-primary-keys-goes-100-for-rails-21/">from version 1.0.0</a> it finally catches up with Active Record 2.1. Erubis, the fast alternative to <span class="caps">ERB</span>, has rolled out support for Rails 2.1 as well, in their 2.6.1 version. A week later, version 2.6.2 was released and it includes support for Ruby 1.9 as well. You can install it by running<br>
<code>gem install erubis</code> or by <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1320&amp;release_id=22856">downloading it</a> from RubyForge.</p>
<p>Last week Ryan Bates put out another two Railscasts. The first is about <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/113">how to contribute to Rails using Git</a> and is, needless to say, highly recommended. The <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/114">second one</a> is in regards to substituting pagination with the effect of endless scrolling, like DZone does. As pointed out, there are plugins that do this, but Ryan&#8217;s approach builds it from scratch and is definitely worth checking out.</p>
<p>Other interesting articles were: a concise guide to <a href="http://freelancing-gods.com/posts/a_concise_guide_to_using_thinking_sphinx">using the Thinking Sphinx</a> plugin (along with the pre-requisite <a href="http://freelancing-gods.com/posts/sphinx_a_primer">Sphinx primer</a>), <a href="http://szeryf.wordpress.com/2008/06/13/easy-and-flexible-breadcrumbs-for-rails/">Easy and Flexible Breadcrumbs for Rails</a> even though they are clearly <a href="http://jakescruggs.blogspot.com/2008/06/breadcrumbs-are-evil.html">not everyone&#8217;s cup of tea</a>, and lastly <a href="http://www.intridea.com/2008/6/11/gemplugins-a-brief-introduction-to-the-future-of-rails-plugins">GemPlugins: A Brief Introduction to the Future of Rails Plugins</a>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, two announcements were previously reported in this blog, but they are both worth repeating. The first is the release of <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2008/6/13/capistrano-2-4-0">Capistrano 2.4</a> and the second is that registration has opened up for <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/railseurope2008/public/content/home">RailsConf Europe 2008</a>. The conference will be held in Berlin, Germany from the 2nd to the 4th of September. By registering before July 15th, you can save up to 150 euros.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for this week. As you can see there is no shortage of material, given that we&#8217;re such an active community.
