<p>This week I&#8217;m happy to tell you about a new set of articles which will be appearing here on the Rails blog called &#8220;Community Highlights&#8221;.  This new series will feature people/projects/sites from the Rails community that may deserve a little extra recognition.</p>
<p>This week, we&#8217;re going to start with a few people who received awards on stage at Railsconf 2009, this years Ruby Heroes.</p>

Over the past year he&#8217;s written an incredible number <a href="http://railstips.org/smorgasbord/">educational blog posts</a> on many Ruby and Rails topics.</p>
